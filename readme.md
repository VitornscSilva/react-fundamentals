# Building a React App from Scratch with Webpack and Exploring React Fundamentals

This repository serves as a step-by-step guide to build a React application from the ground up using Webpack as the bundler. Along the way, we'll explore essential React fundamentals such as `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useContext`. We'll also dive into configuring various styling approaches including CSS modules, SCSS modules, and Styled Components.

By following the commits in this repository, you'll be able to learn and understand the process of setting up a React application, implementing key React concepts, and configuring different styling techniques. Whether you're new to React or looking to solidify your understanding, this repository has you covered.
